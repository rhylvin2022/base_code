# Base Code Template

This repository contains my personal **Flutter base code**, designed and developed by **Rhylvin Dale Tinador**. It serves as a ready‑to‑use, production‑oriented foundation for any future Flutter projects I create.

## Purpose

This base code is built to streamline development for my upcoming applications. It includes the essential structure, configurations, and patterns I use across projects, allowing me to start new work quickly and consistently.

## Key Features

Below are the core features and components already implemented in this base code, all personally developed and structured to fit my workflow and future projects:

### 🔹 Navigation & Routing

* **Beamer Routing Implemented** – Fully configured for scalable and modular navigation.
* **Defined Navigation Routes** – Clean and centralized navigation setup.
* **BeamGuard** – Route protection and guard logic included for authenticated vs unauthenticated flow.

### 🔹 State Management

* **BLoC State Management** – Architecture set up across the app.
* **Authentication BLoC** – Handles login, logout, and session states.

### 🔹 UI & Utilities

* **Reusable Alert Dialog Screen** – Pre-built dialog structure ready to use.
* **app_image** – Centralized asset image management.
* **app_string** – Centralized string constants for maintainability.
* **Text Field Validation** – Common validation logic implemented and reusable.

### 🔹 Pages & Flow

* **Splash Page** – Initial entry point deciding next route.
* **Login Page** – Handles authentication flow.
* **Home Page** – Displays fetched data and provides logout functionality.
* **Complete Flow:** Splash → Login → Authenticate → Home → Logout → Back to Login.

### 🔹 API Integration

* **Sample API Integration** – Demonstrates fetching data and displaying it on the Home page.

* **State Management:** BLoC Architecture implemented

* **Scalable Project Structure**

* **Production‑ready Configurations**

* **Clean & Maintainable Codebase**

## Getting Started

This project template is fully prepared and structured based on my own development standards. It includes the architecture, patterns, and setup that I personally use when building Flutter applications. No external guides or references were used in creating this base code.

# Base Code (Assessment Version)

This repository also includes a version of the base code used for an **assessment project** I am completing for a company I aim to work for.

## Purpose

This version demonstrates my development approach, coding style, and architectural structure using my personal base setup.

## Key Features

* Same core functionalities as my primary base code
* Tailored adjustments depending on the assessment requirements
* Clean, maintainable, and scalable architecture showcasing my Flutter development capabilities

If you're reviewing this for assessment purposes, this reflects how I build the foundation of my actual production applications.
